# Block Villager Trades

Block Villager Trades ‚Äî a plugin that allows you to block or remove villager trades based on a configurable list of items and enchantments.

## ‚ú® Features

- Full item blocking - specify item/material name you want to block
- Blocking by enchantments - if an item contains one of the specified enchantments, the trade will be blocked. You can also specify level of blocked enchantment. If not set all levels of  the enchantment will be blocked.
- Two modes of operation
  - Block trade ‚Äî the trade remains visible but cannot be used/restock.
  - Remove trade ‚Äî the blocked trade disappears from the villager‚Äôs interface. **WARNING: This will permanently delete the trade, and it will not be restored even if you remove the item from the blocked list.**
